## Code Example: Sorting Hat Function

```javascript
function sortingHat(name) {
  const houses = ["Gryffindor", "Hufflepuff", "Ravenclaw", "Slytherin"];
  const hash = name.split('').reduce((a, b) => a + b.charCodeAt(0), 0);
  return houses[hash % houses.length];
}

// Example: Which house would you be in?
console.log(sortingHat("Harry")); // Output might be "Gryffindor"
```

## Fantasy vs. Reality

Fiction can teach us important life lessons.[^1]

[^1]: This is especially true in coming-of-age stories like Harry Potter and Mean Girls.

### Things I Love About These Stories {#favorites}

**Character Development**:
- [x] Complex heroes and villains
- [x] Strong character arcs
- [ ] Perfect characters with no flaws

~~Fantasy stories are just for kids.~~ People of all ages can enjoy and learn from these tales!

I find the themes of friendship and courage in Harry Potter to be ==particularly moving== examples of storytelling.

## Scientific Elements

While not scientific, magic in Harry Potter could be seen as following its own natural laws, like H~2~O has specific properties in our world.

The power of the One Ring in Lord of the Rings increases exponentially (power = ring^2^) the closer it gets to Mount Doom!
